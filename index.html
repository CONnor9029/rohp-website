After the program ends, students can also visit both the UC Berkeley Botanical Gardens and BAMPFA (The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive).

        and I really enjoyed studying abroad in Peru back in Summer 2019. In my freshman year, I was
        an intern for the Berkeley City Auditor and worked for her campaign. In the future, I’m
        interested in working in law, education, or with animals in some capacity. Please feel free

        Hey there!!! My name is Sarah Truong, and I am one of the coordinators leading ROHP this year!
        I am a fourth-year from Anaheim, CA studying Earth and Planetary Science, Data Science, and
        Computer Science! Other campus organizations that I'm a part of include the Computer Science
        Scholars Program, Association of Women in EE&CS, Society of Women in Physics, and the Data
        Science Scholars Program. In addition, I am the youngest undergraduate instructor for the
        award-wining course of over 900 students, Introduction to General Astronomy (Astro C10)! I
        am an undergraduate student researcher for two different research labs, one of which is led
        by Nobel laureate in Physics, Saul Perlmutter, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory!
        In my free time, I love to go on spontaneous trips with my friends, clown around, listen to
        the "Binge Mode" podcast, watch the sunset at the beach, go stargazing, curate Spotify playlists,
        watch NBA basketball games, and interior design my friends' apartments! I love meeting potential
        Berkeley students, so feel free to reach out to me with any questions!

        playing video games, and reading ancient literature. Feel free to ask me any questions about
        research, RCSA, welcoming events, or just student life in general at Berkeley! ROHP has been

        workshop/redesign my very colorful four year plan, learn new languages (currently working on
        German & Esperanto), and take naps. ROHP was one of the main reasons I elected to come to
